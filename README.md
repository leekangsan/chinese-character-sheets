# Chinese Character Sheets - Generate Chinese Character Practice Sheets with ease

Uses the fontkit branch of [pdfkit](http://pdfkit.org/), kindly packaged by [fzcs](https://www.npmjs.com/~fzcs) for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fzcs-pdfkit-fontkit).

Note that I commented out most of the registered formats in fontkit/index.js to keep the filesize of the javascript bundle within reason.

The font is based on the freely available [AR PL UKai](http://packages.ubuntu.com/fonts-arphic-ukai) font collection, converted from TTC to TTF with [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/).

The HSK word lists were adapted from [http://www.hskhsk.com/word-lists.html](http://www.hskhsk.com/word-lists.html).
